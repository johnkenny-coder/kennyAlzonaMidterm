# ReactJS Setup Guide

## Overview
React is a JavaScript library that helps you build and organize user interfaces for web applications. It works by using components, which are self-contained pieces of code that combine reusable JavaScript and HTML. React also uses JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax that allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside your JavaScript files, making it easier to create and manage web pages.

## Requirements
Before setting up React, ensure you have the following:

- **JavaScript**: You should be familiar with JavaScript basics such as arrays, classes, objects, and ES6 features (e.g., arrow functions).
- **HTML**: React components involve rendering HTML elements and applying CSS.
- **Text Editor**: It's recommended to use **VS Code** for a better development experience.
- **Node.js**: You will need **Node.js**, which is a backend JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

## ReactJS Setup

### Step 1: Create a Project Folder
1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Create a new folder for your React project.

### Step 2: Open the Terminal
1. Go to the **hamburger menu** (the three horizontal lines) at the top of **VS Code**.
2. Click on **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
3. In the terminal, change it to **Command Prompt** if it's not already set.

### Step 3: Create the Project
In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
